# Hacker101 CTF - Getting Started

Welcome to the Hacker101 CTF! This document will help you get started with the CTF and guide you through the process of solving the challenges.

## What is the Hacker101 CTF?

The Hacker101 CTF is a series of challenges that are designed to teach you web application security. Each challenge is a simulated web application that is vulnerable to a specific type of attack. Your goal is to find and exploit the vulnerability to gain access to the flag.

## How to get started

To get started with the CTF, you will need to create an account on the Hacker101 website. Once you have created an account, you can access the CTF challenges by clicking on the "CTF" tab in the navigation bar.

### Registering for the CTF

1. Go to the [Hacker101 website](https://ctf.hacker101.com/).

2. Click on the "Sign Up" button to create an account.


## Solving the challenges

To solve a challenge, you will need to find and exploit the vulnerability in the web application. Once you have found the vulnerability, you can use it to gain access to the flag. The flag is a unique string that you can submit to the CTF platform to mark the challenge as complete.

### Setting up your environment (optional)

Before you start solving challenges, you may want to set up a hacking environment. This can include tools like:

- [Kali Linux](/kali-linux) or another penetration testing distribution.
- A web proxy like [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp).

### Starting a challenge

1. Go to [the CTF challanges page](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf).

2. Click **start** on the challenge you want to solve.

### Submitting a flag

1. Once you have found the flag, copy it to your clipboard.

2. Go to the [submit flag page](https://ctf.hacker101.com/ctf/submit_flag).

## Getting help

If you get stuck on a challenge, don't worry! There are plenty of resources available to help you. You can ask for help in the Hacker101 Discord server, read the hints provided in the challenge description, or watch the video walkthroughs that are available for some challenges.

## Conclusion

The Hacker101 CTF is a great way to learn web application security and practice your hacking skills. We hope you enjoy the challenges and learn something new along the way. Happy hacking!
